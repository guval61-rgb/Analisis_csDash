 CHEAT SHEETS

Fellow trader, 
 
By now, you've hopefully been watching my videos, and have a pretty good idea about what correlation trading is, and if you're anything like me, your interest is likely peaked to a point of almost jumping out of your skin... 
 
I know that's how I felt once I began to see the “correlation patterns” or “cracks” in the market as I like to call them.  What is so exciting about trading this way, is that you're basically taking advantage of what I like to call “Fundamental Law”, which really means that the trades you take are all based on what pretty much HAS to happen in the market, NOT, as we've always been used to, what we're EXPECTING or HOPING to happen. 
 
And believe me when I say the difference is monumental. 
 
Within this brief “Cheat Sheets” report, I’m going to prove to you why trading with two charts, or as I like to call it, “double-up charting” is far superior to looking at just one chart at a time (“double-up charting” is one of the basic principals of my Correlation Methodology ).
 
Before I get any further, if you haven’t read my “Correlation Secrets” report you’ll want to do that FIRST so you can have a basic understanding of correlations before you dive into these cheat sheets.

Ok, let's jump in! 
 
Almost all correlation trades start out the same way…by waiting for correlated pairs to fall OUT of correlation.  As I discussed in the “Correlation Secrets” special report, when correlated pairs fall out of correlation, it creates a “predictable volatility” that savvy traders can monetize… 
 
…and it’s these very “cheat sheets” that will tell you how to turn “predictable volatility” into PROFITS!  
 
Once you have identified two correlated pairs moving out of correlation, you are then left with a choice of how to trade this opportunity. You can: 
 
1. Use a scalping strategy to get in, get out, and a grab a few pips in the process… 
2. Use a swing trading strategy and wait for one of the pairs to “swing” back into correlation, or… 
3. Take a longer-term position and potentially profit from both legs of the correlation trade… 
 
Each of the three trading strategies have upsides and down-sides, so the decision of which strategy will largely be driven by your own trading preferences. 
 
But no matter your style of trading…scalping…swing trading…long-term trading…correlation trading will accommodate you. And in these “cheat sheets” you’ll find a formula for profiting from all three trading styles. 
 
Now...let’s dive in and start trading! 
 

IMPORTANT: Watch This Video FIRST… 
Keep in mind that these “cheat sheets” are just that…CHEAT SHEETS. 
 
They are not intended to be a complete discussion of correlation trading or even of the strategies themselves. For a full breakdown and explanation of how each strategy should be traded, I highly recommend that you watch the training video that came with this report BEFORE you read any further, and I would recommend you go as far as watching the other few videos I've posted on the blog as well. (You'll even see the “Sunday Afternoon” video, referenced in my email that has a 90%+ probability of being successful!)

Final Thoughts… 
 
As you can see from the trades above, trading correlated pairs using two charts shows you moments of opportunities that you would have likely NEVER seen when trading with only one chart (or how you've BEEN trading).  
 
Watching correlated pairs move in and out of correlation can allow you to profit regardless of the type of trading you like to do: 1) scalping, 2) swing trading, or 3) longer-term trading – and typically with a FAR HIGHER degree of accuracy – which is why I can tell you flat out... 
 
…“It's my very favorite way of trading!” 
 
Oh, and keep in mind, for those traders who are a little BOLD, there’s a 4th option that’s in addition to scalping, swing trading and long-term trading. 
 
That 4th option is to simply…TRADE ALL THREE STRATEGIES AT ONCE! 
 
That’s right…if you don’t want to pick just one strategy, you don’t have to! You can instead decide to trade all three at the same time. 
 
I call this my “TRIPLE STACKER” technique because you’re literally stacking three types of trades on top of one another! 
 
Obviously you’ll need to have a trading account that’s large enough to handle this much exposure without becoming over-leveraged, but for more experienced traders taking all three trading opportunities can actually work like a “hedge” that 1) reduces your risk and 2) can potentially increase your overall profits. 
 
Take the examples above, for instance… 
 
The profit totals for each strategy are as follows: 
 
 	Scalping: +24 
 	Swing Trade: +38 
 	Long-Term: +148 
 
To be perfectly transparent with you, this example is NOT indicative of normal trading performance. Normally one or more of the three trading strategies will go against you, so if you trade just one of the strategies there’s a good chance it could go against you. 
 
If you trade all three, on the other hand, my research and testing shows that you’ll be more profitable in the long-run, because most of the time at least one or more of the three trading strategies is profitable, and that one strategy winner will help to offset any losses that may occur in the other strategies.  
 
REMEMBER: Correlation trading is backed by universal market fundamentals “or FUNDAMENTAL  LAW”, so you can trade these strategies with extreme confidence knowing the market is on your side. 
 
Again, there are no guarantees when trading any market…much less the Forex. In my experience, though, taking every trading opportunity (whether it be a scalping trade, a swing trade or a long-term trade) will help even out your winners and losers and over time make you a more CONFIDENT, profitable trader. 
 
With all that said, if you want to truly sky-rocket your confidence (and accuracy) by removing 99% of the subjectivity from your correlation trades, I highly recommend you check out my “Correlation Code” trading system. 
 
“Correlation Code” combines 8 tested and proven correlation trading strategies, so no matter your trading style there’s a strategy that will fit YOU.  
 
And as a “Correlation Code” member, you’ll also have access to our proprietary trading indicators that tell you EXACTLY:

Trading is what I love, and trading is what I DO as a profession. 
 
I also enjoy teaching and helping other active traders get an edge. I know from personal experience that most trading systems and advice are 100% crap, and it’s my mission to provide something that actually works to independent traders just like me.
